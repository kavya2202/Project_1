To Digitilize the manual procedure of Outing Process
    _Nowadays, boarding schools or colleges uses outing book for the hostel students to go outing. Before they go outing, they need to fill in the book and the hostel administration needs to put a stamp on it as an approval. The existing hostel outing system requires tedious process, manual efforts and it is also time consuming.

To overcome these problems, we have developed a web-based system, which can help both the hostel administration and the students. This application allows the students to apply the outing online and the hostel administration gives the approvals through online there by eliminating the manual process. After returning, the details are updated in the system so that the complete outing history of the student can be accessible at any time.
